# PASCAL EXPERIMENTING

There's nothing special here- I just got bored during my downtime between looking for a proper job, and cleaning houses. I figured I might as well pick up a new language. So far, I've started to grow more comfortable with the syntax, and I'm finding myself liking the language a fair bit.

I've written a few fairly basic functions, including both a iterative, recursive, and cached version of the fibonacci sequence. I also misspelled fibonacci several times. Now that I've got everything from file I/O to recursive and dynamic programming down, It's time I moved on to object oriented paradigms.

After that, I'll start porting some of my completed programing challenges from C++ to pascal.
